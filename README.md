The traffic light controller is implemented as a finite state machine with four states (s0–s3) to manage traffic flow between a highway road and a country road. In the default state s0, the highway road signal remains green while the country road signal is red, giving priority to highway traffic. When vehicles are detected on the country road (x = 1), the controller transitions from s0 to s1, where the highway signal changes to yellow while the country road remains red, indicating an upcoming stop. The transition from s1 to s2 introduces a delay of five positive clock cycles to ensure a safe change from yellow to red on the highway road. In state s2, the country road receives a green signal and the highway road remains red; the controller stays in this state as long as x = 1. Once no vehicles are detected on the country road (x = 0), the system transitions to s3, a brief transition state, and then returns to the default state s0. All state transitions occur synchronously on the positive edge of the clock, ensuring predictable and reliable operation of the traffic light controller.
